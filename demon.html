                cartilage allows the Hell Razer to focus its energy beam into a

                The Dread Knight is a brand new cyborg demon to Doom Eternal. A

                access to a wider range of attacks and sports dual wrist-mounted

                It was originally known as the Hunters of Agaddon from the realm

                event called the "unholy crusade". - Although the species is
                believed to have long since gone extinct, according to at least
                one hunter of Agaddon somehow made it to Earth, wintering for
                millennia in a remote region of what would become Antarctica.
